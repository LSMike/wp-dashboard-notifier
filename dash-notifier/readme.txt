== Description ==

This plugin can be used to notify clients with a banner in WordPress dashboard only. Need to be called via API.

To add a new banner, predefine a PHP const `DASH_NOTIFIER_MSG` before hook `setup_theme` like below:

```
define( 'DASH_NOTIFIER_MSG', json_encode( array( 'msg' => 'Your message to display in banner', 'plugin' => 'your_plugin_slug', 'plugin_name' => 'Your Plugin Name' ) ) ) ;
```

The `your_plugin_slug` is optional. If set, there will generate an one click install button along with the message in banner.

If the plugin is https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/, the `your_plugin_slug` will be `hello-dolly` and `Plugin Name` will be `Hello Dolly`.

If `plugin` is provided but `plugin_name` is empty, it will default to the official name on WordPress Plugin list.
